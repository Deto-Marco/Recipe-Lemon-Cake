# Lemon drizzle slices

I am partial to a slice of lemon drizzle and that's why I decided to include it in the afternoon tea that I served at Cliveden House during my visit back there. This cake is decorated with a feather icing and it looks really impressive, but it's incredibly easy to make. I like to serve it in slices.
